# Desert 2k26

## A. Abstract

I searched for You and lost my way. I longed for Your word but could no longer hear it. A ceaseless noise tempted me, but my mother’s voice guided my heart. She never left.

I saw a face cracked into a mad grimace. It was Death, greeting me: visit my world, it said. I’m in every puddle of piss at six in the morning.

## B. Prayer

Father, grant me understanding of today’s temptations. Lead me not into them, but deliver me from evil. Amen.

## C. Introduction

Madrid. Trails of vomit. Voices rasped by too many cigarettes. It’s cold when you step out of that damp, warm dive. The air feels clean once you stop breathing the sweet smell of so many strangers’ sweat.

This place brims with temptations. We are so young. Why didn’t you tell me about them? Jesus, so many Sundays I heard of Your forty days of trial. What would You do in this fucking city?

Tus ojos negros, lloran mi sange, son cuchillas, son navajas. Tus ojos negros son alquitrán, dos cuchillas en mi costal [2].</em>
